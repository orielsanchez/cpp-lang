Here’s a task list for each module of the software planning course:

---

### **Module 1: Introduction to Software Planning**

**Task 1.1: Study the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**
- Research and summarize the phases of the SDLC.
- Compare Waterfall and Agile models in a table format.
- Select a small project idea and write down the phases of the SDLC for this project.

**Task 1.2: Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
- Research use case diagrams and user stories.
- Write 3-5 user stories for your chosen project.
- Create a draft SRS document for the project, including functional and non-functional requirements.

---

### **Module 2: Object-Oriented Design**

**Task 2.1: Apply Basic OOP Principles**
- Create class diagrams for a simple system (e.g., library management system).
- Write down how each OOP principle (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) applies to your classes.

**Task 2.2: Design Class Relationships**
- Research UML class diagrams and different types of relationships (association, aggregation, composition).
- Design the class relationships for your project, indicating how they are connected.
- Implement one or two key classes in C++ with basic methods and attributes.

**Task 2.3: Refactor Code for SOLID Principles**
- Research SOLID principles.
- Analyze the initial design of your classes.
- Refactor one or more classes to adhere to SOLID principles (e.g., implement single responsibility, avoid tight coupling).

---

### **Module 3: Software Architecture Patterns**

**Task 3.1: Design a Layered Architecture**
- Research the concept of a three-tier or layered architecture.
- Write a breakdown of how your project can be divided into layers (e.g., UI, logic, data).
- Create a diagram illustrating the layers and their interactions.

**Task 3.2: Implement an MVC Framework**
- Research the MVC pattern.
- Map out the model, view, and controller components for a small project (e.g., a to-do app).
- Implement a basic project using the MVC pattern in C++ or another language with support for MVC frameworks.

**Task 3.3: Plan for Microservices Architecture**
- Research microservices architecture and its advantages.
- Identify components of your project that could be decoupled into microservices.
- Write a plan for splitting the application into services, including communication between them.

---

### **Module 4: Software Design Patterns**

**Task 4.1: Implement Creational Patterns**
- Research Singleton, Factory, and Builder patterns.
- Implement a Singleton class in your project for a configuration manager.
- Create a Factory pattern to manage the creation of different types of objects in your project.

**Task 4.2: Apply Structural Patterns**
- Research Adapter, Facade, and Composite patterns.
- Implement an Adapter pattern to allow one of your classes to interface with an external library.
- Design a Facade to simplify complex interactions between multiple classes in your project.

**Task 4.3: Implement Behavioral Patterns**
- Research Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.
- Implement an Observer pattern in your project to handle events, like updating a UI when data changes.
- Use the Strategy pattern to switch between different algorithms or behaviors (e.g., different ways to sort data).

---

### **Module 5: Practical Application in C++**

**Task 5.1: Set Up Your C++ Project**
- Research best practices for organizing C++ project files.
- Create a directory structure for your project with separate folders for headers, sources, and tests.
- Write a `Makefile` or set up a CMake project to automate the build process.

**Task 5.2: Decompose Requirements into Classes**
- Review the SRS from Module 1.
- Identify the main classes needed to meet the requirements.
- Write down the responsibilities and attributes for each class in a detailed plan.
- Start writing header files for each class.

**Task 5.3: Build and Test Your Project**
- Write implementations for your classes in the `.cpp` files.
- Build and compile the project using your makefile or CMake setup.
- Write simple tests to ensure each class is functioning as expected.

---

### **Module 6: Testing and Refactoring**

**Task 6.1: Implement Unit Tests**
- Research unit testing frameworks like Google Test for C++.
- Write unit tests for 3-5 core classes in your project.
- Set up an automated testing pipeline to run tests after each build.

**Task 6.2: Refactor Code for Maintainability**
- Review the project for code smells (e.g., duplicated code, overly complex functions).
- Identify areas where SOLID principles can improve your design.
- Refactor your code to reduce complexity, improve naming conventions, and remove unnecessary dependencies.

---

### **Module 7: Deployment and Maintenance**

**Task 7.1: Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline**
- Research CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Travis CI.
- Write a configuration file to automate the building, testing, and deployment of your project.
- Set up notifications for when builds succeed or fail.

**Task 7.2: Manage Source Control with Git**
- Research best practices for using Git, such as feature branches and pull requests.
- Create a Git repository for your project and start committing code regularly.
- Manage branches for different features or bug fixes, and practice merging them.

**Task 7.3: Plan for Maintenance**
- Write a maintenance plan for your project, including how you’ll handle versioning, bug fixes, and adding new features.
- Review your codebase and ensure it’s documented well enough for other developers (or future you) to understand and maintain.

These tasks will guide you through each module, ensuring you apply theoretical knowledge in a practical way. By the end of the course, you’ll have both a solid understanding of software planning and a working project in C++.
