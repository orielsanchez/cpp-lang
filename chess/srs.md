## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  
**Project Name**: C++ Chess Engine  
**Date**: 8/17/2024
**Version**: 1.0  

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose  
This document describes the software requirements for a Chess Engine built in C++.
It details the system’s functionality, performance, constraints, and quality attributes.

#### 1.2 Scope  
The Chess Engine will implement the rules of chess, 
allow for two-player gameplay (human vs human or human vs AI), 
and provide AI with varying levels of difficulty.
The engine will also offer board state management, move generation, validation, and game state evaluation.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
- **FEN**: Forsyth-Edwards Notation (a standard for chess position notation)
- **UCI**: Universal Chess Interface (a standard protocol for communicating with chess engines)

#### 1.4 Overview  
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the Chess Engine,
including system functionality, user interaction, and external interface specifications.

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Perspective  
The Chess Engine will function as a standalone application but should be designed modularly 
to support integration with GUI interfaces or chess server APIs.
The engine’s core includes move generation, board evaluation, and decision-making algorithms.

#### 2.2 Product Functions  
The system must support the following:
- Basic chess rule enforcement (e.g., legal moves, check, checkmate, stalemate).
- Turn-based gameplay (white moves first, alternating turns).
- Move validation and generation based on board position.
- AI-controlled player option with difficulty settings.
- FEN parsing for setting up board states.
- UCI protocol for chess engine communication.

#### 2.3 User Characteristics  
The target user is either:
- A chess enthusiast who wants to play against an AI or another human player.
- A developer or researcher integrating the engine into a larger system such as a chess GUI.

#### 2.4 Constraints  
- The engine must be developed in C++ and should be as performant as possible.
- It should adhere to chess rules as defined by FIDE.
- All AI algorithms must be implemented efficiently due to the potential large search space of chess positions.

#### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies  
- A basic command-line interface will be used for gameplay initially.
- The engine will assume an 8x8 standard chessboard.
- AI difficulty will be based on depth of move tree search.
- Future enhancements may involve external libraries for GUI or networked play.

### 3. Specific Requirements

#### 3.1 Functional Requirements

**3.1.1 Game Setup**
- The system shall initialize an 8x8 chessboard with the standard chess setup.
- The system shall allow game initialization from a FEN string to load specific board positions.

**3.1.2 Move Generation**
- The system shall generate all legal moves for a given board state.
- The system shall validate player input to ensure legality.
- The system shall prevent illegal moves (e.g., moves that put the player's king in check).

**3.1.3 AI Player**
- The system shall support AI opponents of varying difficulty levels.
  - Level 1: Random move selection from the legal moves.
  - Level 2: Minimax algorithm with depth-limited search.
  - Level 3: Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and heuristic evaluation functions.

**3.1.4 Game State Management**
- The system shall evaluate game state to determine check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions.
- The system shall maintain a history of moves for undo functionality.
- The system shall allow for resignation or draw offers by either player.

**3.1.5 User Interaction**
- The system shall accept user input for making moves in algebraic notation (e.g., e2 to e4).
- The system shall display the updated board after each move.
- The system shall provide feedback on illegal moves.

**3.1.6 External Interface**
- The system shall support the UCI protocol for communication with external chess GUIs.

### 4. Performance Requirements

- **4.1 Response Time**: The system shall generate legal moves and AI decisions within 1 second for standard difficulty levels.
- **4.2 Scalability**: The engine should handle increasing difficulty levels by scaling up the search depth of the AI.
- **4.3 Resource Usage**: The engine should minimize CPU and memory usage where possible while maintaining performance.

---

### 5. Design Constraints

- The system shall be written in C++ and follow object-oriented design principles.
- The system shall be modular, separating concerns like move generation, AI decision-making, and board representation.

---

### 6. Quality Attributes

- **6.1 Reliability**: The engine must reliably enforce chess rules and maintain a valid game state.
- **6.2 Usability**: User input should be easy to understand (e.g., algebraic notation for moves).
- **6.3 Maintainability**: The code should be modular and well-documented to support future development.
- **6.4 Portability**: The code should be platform-independent, capable of running on different operating systems.

---

### 7. Other Non-Functional Requirements

- **7.1 Testability**: The system shall include unit tests for critical functions like move generation and board evaluation.
- **7.2 Security**: The engine shall not allow illegal game state manipulation (e.g., illegal board setup).
